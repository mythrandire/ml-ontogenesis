# Some (work-in-progress) ideas on docstring conventions

> **Note: This convention was auto-generated by providing a carefully worded prompt to GPT-4.**

## Prompt
I want you to create a cohesive, sensible protocol for writing Python docstrings. 

This protocol must provide distinct, easily differentiable rules to write docstrings for standalone Python functions, parent/base classes, child classes, unimplemented abstract methods, implementations of them, static methods, etc. There should also be a differentiation in how functions with no return value must be handled, versus functions that have a determined return type.

The docstring protocol must define a rigid scheme for succinctly describing the function, method, or class's primary purpose, with special care to explain details that are not clear from the method's signature. You must define a consistent template for describing input parameters and output return types.

For classes, if the class in question inherits from multiple parents, the class docstring must reflect this. If the class inherits from another child class, the complete "parentage" of the class should be outlined in the docstring. 

Adhere to these rules strictly and create a complete and systematically arranged list outlining these rules. To illustrate each rule, create a single dummy Python library with templates, dummy classes, and methods that clearly demonstrate the application of each rule.  Highlight an example of each rule from this library. 

## Response

Creating a cohesive and sensible protocol for writing Python docstrings that differentiate between various types of functions, methods, and classes is crucial for maintaining clarity, readability, and ease of maintenance in codebases. Below, I outline a protocol that addresses these requirements, followed by a demonstration via a dummy Python library.

### Protocol for Writing Python Docstrings

1. **General Structure for All Docstrings:**
   - **Purpose**: Start with a concise one-liner summarizing the functionality.
   - **Parameters**: List each parameter name, followed by its expected type in parentheses, and a brief description.
   - **Returns**: Specify the return type and a description of the return value.
   - **Raises**: List exceptions that can be raised and under what conditions.
   - **Examples**: Provide simple examples of how to use the function, method, or class.

2. **Standalone Functions:**
   - Focus on the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, return type, raised exceptions, and include an example.

3. **Parent/Base Classes:**
   - Describe the class's purpose, its public methods, attributes, and any important internal mechanisms without exposing implementation details. Include inheritance information if applicable.

4. **Child Classes:**
   - Include a complete "parentage" line showing the inheritance path.
   - Highlight overridden methods and any additional functionality specific to the child class.

5. **Unimplemented Abstract Methods:**
   - Clearly state that the method is intended to be overridden and describe what it should accomplish when implemented.

6. **Implementations of Abstract Methods:**
   - Detail how the abstract method has been implemented, focusing on the implementation specifics not evident from the abstract definition.

7. **Static Methods:**
   - Indicate that the method is static.
   - Follow the general structure but emphasize that it operates independently of class instance state.

8. **Functions with No Return Value:**
   - Explicitly state "None" as the return type and describe the side-effects or purpose of the function instead of a return value.

9. **Functions with a Determined Return Type:**
   - Clearly specify the return type and describe what the returned object represents or contains.

10. **Class Inheritance:**
    - For multiple inheritances, list all parent classes in the docstring.
    - For inherited child classes, include the complete inheritance hierarchy.

### Dummy Python Library Example

```python
class BaseClass:
    """
    Base class for demonstration purposes.
    
    Methods:
        abstract_method(param1): An abstract method to be implemented by child classes.
    """
    def abstract_method(self, param1):
        """
        An unimplemented abstract method.
        
        Parameters:
            param1 (str): Description of param1.
            
        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: Always, as this method is intended to be overridden.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("This method is abstract and must be overridden.")

class ChildClass(BaseClass):
    """
    Child class demonstrating inheritance from BaseClass.
    
    Inherits:
        BaseClass
    
    Overrides:
        abstract_method(param1)
    """
    def abstract_method(self, param1):
        """
        Implementation of the abstract method from BaseClass.
        
        Parameters:
            param1 (str): Description of param1.
            
        Returns:
            bool: Description of the return value.
        """
        return True

def standalone_function(param1, param2):
    """
    A standalone function demonstration.
    
    Parameters:
        param1 (int): Description of param1.
        param2 (str): Description of param2.
        
    Returns:
        list: Description of the return value.
        
    Examples:
        >>> standalone_function(5, 'example')
        [5, 'example']
    """
    return [param1, param2]

class MultiInheritClass(BaseClass, SomeOtherClass):
    """
    Demonstrates a class with multiple inheritance.
    
    Inherits:
        BaseClass, SomeOtherClass
    """
```

This protocol and example library provide a clear, structured approach to writing Python docstrings, enhancing code readability and maintainability across diverse Python projects.
